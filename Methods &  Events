    
    JavaScript methods are actions that can be performed on objects.
    
    A JavaScript **method** is a property containing a **function definition**.
    
    *objectName.methodName()*
    
    example:name = person.fullName();
    
    - Events
    
    HTML events are **"things"** that happen to HTML elements.
    
    When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can **"react"** on these events.
    
    examples of HTML events:
    
    - An HTML web page has finished loading
    - An HTML input field was changed
    - An HTML button was clicked
    
    JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected.
    
    HTML allows event handler attributes, **with JavaScript code**, to be added to HTML elements.
    
    With single quotes:
    
    <*element* *event*=**'*some JavaScript*'**>
    
    With double quotes:
    
    <*element* *event*=**"*some JavaScript*"**>
