        conditional statement are used to perform different actions based on different conditions
    
    - if
        
        use to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
        
        if (condition)
        
        {
        
        // block of code to be executed if the condition is true}
        
        example - if(hour < 18){
        
        greeting - “good day”;
        
        }
        
    - else
        
        to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
        
        if (condition){
        // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
        
        }else{
        
        //block of code to be executed if the condition is false
        
        }
        
        example: if (hour < 18)
        
        greeting - “good day”;
        
        }else {
        
        greeting - “good evening”;
        
        }
        
    - else if
        
        to specify new condition to test, if the first condition is false
        
        if (condition1){
        
        //block of code to be executed if conditional is true
        
        }else if (condition2){
        
        //block of code to be executed if the conditional is false and condition is true
        
        }else {
        
        // block of code to be execute if the condition is false and condition2 is false
        
        }
        
        example: if (time < 10) {
        
        greeting = “good morning”;
        
        } else if (time = 20) {
        
        greeting = “good day”;
        
        } else {
        
        greeting = “good evening”;
        
        }
        
    - switch
        
        to specify many alternative block of code to be executed
        
        switch(expression) {
        
        case x:
        
        //code block
        
        break;
        
        case y:
        
        //code block
        
        break;
        
        default:
        
        //code block
        
        }
        
        example: switch(new Date(). getDay()) {
        
        case 0:
        
        day = “Sunday”;
        
        break;
        
        case 1:
        
        day = “Monday”
        
        break;
        
        case 2:
        
        day = “Tuesday”
        
        break;
        
        case 3:
        
        day = “ Wednesday”;
        
        break;
        
        case 4:
        
        day = “Thursday”;
        
        break;
        
        case 5:
        
        day = “ Friday”;
        
        break;
        
        case 6:
        
        day = “Saturday”;
        
        }
