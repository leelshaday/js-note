     uses when want to run the same code over and over again
    
    - for loop
        
          loops through a block of code a number of times
        
          for statement creates a loop with 3 optional expressions:
        
             for (expression 1; expression 2; expression) {
        
        // code block to be executed}
        
        expression 1: is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.
        
        expression 2: defines the condition for executing the code block.
        
        expression 3: is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.
        
        example: for(let i = 0; i < 5; i++)
        
                       text += “the number is “ + i + “ ;}
        
    - while loop
        
        loops through a block of code while a specified condition in true.
        
          while (condition)
        
          { //code block to be executed }
        
        example: while (i < 10) {
        
        text += “ the number is “ + i;
        
        i++;
        
        }
        
    - Do while loop
        
        loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
        
        do {
        
        //code block to be executed}
        
        while(condition);}
        
        example: do{
        
        text += “ the number is “ + i;
        
        i++;
        
        }
        
        while(i < 10);
