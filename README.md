- variable
    
    variables are containers for storing data
    
    example - var x = 5;
    
                     var y = 6;
    
                     var z = x + y;
    
    x stores the value 5
    
    y stores the value 6
    
    z stores the value 11
    
    always declare JavaScript variables with var , let , const
    
    we use const if we want a general rule
    
    we use let if we think the value of the variable can change
    
- Data type
    
    JS variables can hold different data types: numbers, string, objects, boolean …
    
    example: 
    
    let length = 6; // number
    
    let name = “hana”; //string 
    
- Array
    
    An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values by referring to an index number.
    
    Syntax:
    
    const *array_name* = [*item1*, *item2*, ...];
    
    example 1: const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
    
    example 2:
    
    const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
    
    let car = cars[0]; //Saab
